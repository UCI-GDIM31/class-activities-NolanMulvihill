Pretend I wrote some beautiful metaphor describing Components, GameObjects, and Scenes here.

### W2
R, g, b are all floats because their values fall somewhere between 0-1 as a decimal which can best be represented by floats

_Bounce you can only bounce a whole number of times and it incrmenets by one each time so the best thing to use to represent it is int

Step 4 had the error cant convert double to float and need to inlcude an 'f' to make 1.0 a float

### W3
bool DidPlayerHitBeat(float hit_time){}; 
Assuming that the class contains the expected float for what time as a member variable

Classes are categories and components are the items of that cateogry. For eacample, a class would be food, and components would be hotdog, hambuger, pasta, etc
